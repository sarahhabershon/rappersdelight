This code scrapes lyrics from LyricsGenius (URLs hard-coded because dynamic scraping was foiled by a pop-up. Thanks for making my code ugly, LyricsGenius....) for each rapper nominated for the P3 Guldgalan Swedish music awards.

It identifies all the unique words present in each rapper's sample, then counts how many times those words occur, and returns csv files for each rapper's tally as well as an overall count of the number of unique words each rapper uses within the defined sample word limit.

Findings visualised and contextualised by my team mates on infogram: https://infogram.com/rappers-vocabulary-1hd12yq0d1jx4km?live
